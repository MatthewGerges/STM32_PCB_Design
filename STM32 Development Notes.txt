STM32 Development Notes

- Instead of LDO you'd prolly use switching regulator
capacitors help chip source current from actual supply - might have conductance or resistance and cant get current fast enough so cap would be for local energy storage
-volatage rating should be at least double that of the voltage it's connected to
voltage derating = higher the voltage across the cap = lower the capacitance will be from its nominal value
0.1 microFerrad = standard

Also add bulk decoupling cap
2.2 micro, 4.7 micro or 10 microferrads

vcap is output for internal regulator
Add net name to things that are not vcc or ground

If bootloader is run, it can be reflashed via USB or i2c - pull boot1 pin down low since 
--->we'll just use serial wide debug?
Should put a resistor there that you could desolder and tie to high or a switch

Nreset pin (n = inverted logic), if pulled low the device will reset. So we add a capacitor to create a debouncing or filtering circuit - it has an internal pullup. We also tie it high to 3v3 with pull-up resistor - strength. 
---->IDK why we need pull-up and pull up/down resistors why can't we just tie it high or low
---->What is debouncing or filtering circuit - I still need explanation

Nrst will be connected to serial debug later - IDK
STM32 datasheet can support 4-26 MHZ clock - why can't we just use internal one? 

Crystal has load capacitance - to determine values of capacitors: load capacitance - stray capacitance (2pf for example) * 2 (IDK what stray capacitance is)
