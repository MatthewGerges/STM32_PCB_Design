This is a 4-layer PCB with 2 ground planes for EMI protection and 2 routing layers. It consists of an STM32, an accelerometer (MPU6050) wired via I2C, a TC2030 debug probe, a differential USB, a crystal oscillator, and an LDO. The board also features a TVS diode for ESD protection and a ferrite bead for noise immunity, alongside other passive components that allow the PCB to function. This project was created on Altium Designer\.
I have created a more detailed breakdown of the components used on this board and how it works on my YouTube channel. This video can be found at https://youtu.be/c4NkqKmhvnc
